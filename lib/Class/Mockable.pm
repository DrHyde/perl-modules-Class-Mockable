=head1 NAME

Class::Mockable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A handy mix-in for making stuff mockable.

Use this so that when testing your code you can easily mock how your
code talks to other bits of code, thus making it possible to test
your code in isolation, and without relying on third-party services.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Class::Mockable
        _email_sender         => 'Email::Sender::Simple',
        _email_sent_storage   => 'MyApp::Storage::EmailSent';

is equivalent to:

    {
        my $email_sender;
        _reset_email_sender();
        sub _reset_email_sender {
            $email_sender = 'Email::Sender::Simple'
        };
        sub _email_sender {
            my $class = shift;
            if (exists($_[0])) { $email_sender = shift; }
            return $email_sender;
        }

        my $email_sent_storage;
        _reset_email_sent_storage();
        sub _reset_email_sent_storage {
            $email_sent_storage = 'MyApp::Storage::EmailSent'
        };
        sub _email_sent_storage {
            my $class = shift;
            if (exists($_[0])) { $email_sent_storage = shift; }
            return $email_sent_storage;
        }
    }

=head1 HOW TO USE IT

After setting up as above, the anywhere that your code would want to refer to the class
'Email::Sender::Simple', for example, you would do this:

    my $sender = $self->_email_sender();

In your tests, you would do this:

    My::Module->_email_sender('MyApp::Tests::Mocks::EmailSender');
    ok(My::Module->send_email(...), "email sending stuff works");

where 'MyApp::Tests::Mocks::EmailSender' pretends to be the real email
sending class, only without spamming everyone every time you run the tests.
And of course, if you do want to really send email from a test - perhaps
you want to do an end-to-end test before releasing - you would do this:

    My::Module->_reset_email_sender() if($ENV{RELEASE_TESTING});
    ok(My::Module->send_email(...),
        "email sending stuff works (without mocking)");

to restore the default functionality.


=head2 METHOD MOCKING

We also provide a way of easily inserting shims that wrap around methods
that you have defined.

    use Class::Mockable
        methods => {
            _foo => 'foo',
        };

The above will create a _foo sub on your class that by default will call your
class's foo() subroutine.  This behaviour can be changed by calling the setter
function _set_foo (where _foo is your identifier).  The default behaviour can be
restored by calling _reset_foo (again, where _foo is your identifier).

For example:

    package Some::Module;

    use Class::Mockable
        methods => {
            _bar => 'bar',
        };

    sub bar {
        my $self = shift;
        return "Bar";
    }

    sub foo {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->_bar();
    }

    package main;

    Some::Module->_set_bar(
        sub {
            my $self = shift;
            return "Foo";
        }
    );

    print Some::Module->bar();         # Prints "Bar"
    print Some::Module->foo();         # Prints "Foo"

    Some::Module->_reset_bar();

    print Some::Module->bar();         # Prints "Bar"
    print Some::Module->foo();         # Prints "Bar"

It will also work for inserting a shim into a subclass to wrap around a method
inherited from a superclass.
