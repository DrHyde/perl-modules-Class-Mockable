=head1 NAME

Class::Mock::Method::InterfaceTester

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A helper for Class::Mockable's method mocking

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In the class under test:

    # create a '_foo' wrapper around method 'foo'
    use Class::Mockable
        methods => { _foo => 'foo' };

And then in the tests:

    Some::Module->_set_foo(
        Class::Mock::Method::InterfaceTester->new([
            {
                input  => ...
                output => ...
            }
        ])
    );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This is the constructor.  It returns a blessed sub-ref.  Class::Mockable's
method mocking expects a sub-ref, so will Just Work (tm).

The sub-ref will behave similarly to the method calls defined in
Class::Mock::Generic::InterfaceTester.  That is, it will validate
that the method is being called correctly and emit a test failure if it
isn't, or if called correctly will return the specified value.  If the
method is ever called with the wrong parameters - including if defined
method calls are made in the wrong order - then that's a test failure.

It is also a test failure to call the method fewer or more times than
expected.  Calling it fewer times than expected will be detected very
late - when the subroutine goes away, so either at the end of the process
or when it is redefined, eg with _reset_... (see Class::Mockable).

C<new()> takes an arrayref of hashrefs as its argument.  Those hashes
must have keys 'input' and 'output' whose values define the ins and
outs of each method call in turn.  'input' is always an arrayref which
will get compared to all the method's arguments (excluding the first
one, the object or class itself) but for validating very complex inputs
you may specify a subroutine reference for the input, which will get
executed with the actual input as its argument, and emit a failure if
the call returns false.

If you want to check
that the method is being invoked on the right object or class (if you
are paranoid about inheritance, for example) then use the optional
'invocant_class' string to check that it's being called as a class method
on the right class (not on a subclass, *the right class*), or
invocant_object' string to check that it's being called on an object of
the right class (again, not a subclass), or 'invocant_object' subref to
check that it's being called on an object that, when passed to the sub-ref,
returns true.
